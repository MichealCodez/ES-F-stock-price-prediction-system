# ES-F Stock Price Prediction System

The **ES-F Stock Price Prediction System** is an intelligent stock forecasting tool specifically designed for predicting the Open, High, Close, and Low (OHCL) prices of the ES=F stock. Built on a robust machine learning model, this system utilizes historical data spanning from 2000 to 2022 to make accurate predictions based on the most recent 100 days of stock data. 

## Features

- **Real-Time Predictions**: The system provides real-time predictions for the ES=F stock, allowing users to make informed decisions based on the latest market trends.

- **OHCL Predictions**: The model forecasts the Open, High, Close, and Low prices of the ES=F stock, providing a comprehensive view of the stock's expected performance.

- **Email Notifications**: Upon making predictions, the system automatically sends email notifications to keep users updated about the forecasted stock prices.

## How It Works

1. **Data Training**: The system is trained on a carefully curated dataset spanning from 2000 to 2022. This historical data is used to teach the machine learning model the patterns and trends in ES=F stock prices.

2. **Prediction Algorithm**: The model analyzes the most recent 100 days of stock data to make predictions about the future OHCL prices. Complex algorithms are employed to ensure accurate forecasting.

3. **Real-Time Processing**: The system operates in real-time, continuously analyzing the latest stock data to provide up-to-the-minute predictions.

4. **Email Notifications**: Once the predictions are generated, the system automatically sends email notifications to specified recipients, ensuring that users are promptly informed about the forecasted stock prices.

## Prerequisites

- **Python**: Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
- **Machine Learning Libraries**: Install necessary libraries such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or any other machine learning framework used in the system.
- **Historical Data**: Prepare a dataset containing historical ES=F stock prices from 2000 to 2022 for training the model.

## Usage

1. **Training the Model**: Utilize the historical data to train the machine learning model. You might need to adjust hyperparameters and fine-tune the model for optimal results.

2. **Real-Time Predictions**: Implement the real-time prediction mechanism, ensuring that the system continuously monitors the latest stock data.

3. **Email Integration**: Set up email integration to send notifications. Configure the system to send emails when new predictions are made.

4. **Run the System**: Execute the system, allowing it to make real-time predictions and send email notifications based on the forecasts.
